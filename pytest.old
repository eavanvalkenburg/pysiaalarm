# Specify command line options as you would do when invoking pytest directly.
# e.g. --cov-report html (or xml) for html/xml output or --junitxml junit.xml
# in order to write a coverage file that can be read by Jenkins.
# CAUTION: --cov flags may prohibit setting breakpoints while debugging.
#          Comment those flags to avoid this py.test issue.
